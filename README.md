Objective is to compute the gradient of an image by Sobel edge operators where we construct a kernel and use cv2.filter2D rather than cv2.Sobel. Display the horizontal and vertical direction derivative images. We also compute gradient magnitude images by combining the horizontal and the vertical derivative images and display it
